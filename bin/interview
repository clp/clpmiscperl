Basic: Interview

Write a program that asks the user three or more questions. Store the answer to
each question in a separate scalar variable. Finally, print a message that
includes the answers entered by the user. For example, your program might
output something like this (what the user types is underlined):

  What is your name? Bill
  What is your favorite color? blue
  What type of car do you drive? Honda
  What a coincidence, Bill.  I drive a blue Honda!
