# these errors so that it runs properly without any errors or
# warnings.
#
# It should read the file named on the command line, strip out any
# comments (defined as a substring starting with '#' and continuing to
# the end of the line), whitespace at the beginning or end of the
# line, or blank lines (including lines that contain only spaces), and
# print the results.
